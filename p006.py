# Problem:
#
#     The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#
#     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#     (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
#
#     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
#     ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
#     3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
#     Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
#     one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
